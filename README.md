# MeduaRecorder API Checking
```This repo contains the code that I managed to build.

Pros and Cons based on what I observed after I checked.

Pros:
It can record a video through webcam and can record audio.
Cons:
It doesn't have an option to trim or loop both video and audio.
It can't screen record.
During webcam or audio record, it has a delay after clicking start.
